Before starting the server, remember to start the database. We run both Apache and MySQL. ![](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e-JjzV6RvglRr1IM7LbsMupPXyEBvONx/view)
Remember that if you change the database, you should also make changes on the server in the application.properties -> spring.datasource.url file: ![](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z8NMq8O32MuS4e_f0BOGqqoxaT7bPym0/view)
